# Problem-are-trying-to-solve

India is regarded as the world's capital of heart disease, which is a growing global health concern. Around 70% of heart disease cases worldwide are reported from India, and the main cause of this is that most individuals are unaware of their own heart's actual condition. It is common for people to be unaware of whether they have heart problems or not, which makes it difficult for them to seek timely medical attention, ultimately leading to cardiac arrest and even death.

The demise of well-known comedian Raju Rastogi is a prime illustration of this. When the condition was at its worst in Raju Rastogi's heart, inadequate medical help led to his death from cardiac arrest.
More than 60% of the population in India resides in rural areas, where access and affordability are the two main problems. People lack access to the right hospitals, clinics, and medical professionals who can effectively and promptly predict cardiac disease. Nearly 50% of Indians fall into the middle class, which makes it difficult for them to afford the ₹2000 consultation fee charged by most doctors.

Most middle-class people have a tendency to desire to reduce their monthly expenses, and whether on purpose or not, most people compromise their health needs in the process.

# Our-Solution

PrediFy is a web-based Heart Disease Predictor that can predict whether a user has heart disease or not based on just 13 medical parameters.

Based on PrediFy's prediction, the user would consult his or her doctor for further medication and diagnosis. This website's accuracy is 97%, making it extremely dependable.

# Impact
Many companies have created numerous products to solve this problem, but these products are so expensive that middle-class people cannot even imagine using them, and this problem exists not only in India but in many other countries as well. Only 10% of Indians can buy these devices, but what about the other 90% of the population?

Because our website is free, no one will be hesitant to use it. In short, we are aiming for people from the middle and lower classes and rural areas. By filling the gap between hospitals and the general public and serving them with this creative strategy, we are aiming to reach roughly 50% of the middle-class Indian population by the next few years.
This website will contribute to the accessibility and affordability of healthcare institutions and allow them to do a simple 2-minute heart disease diagnosis.

My goal is to reduce the number of deaths from heart disease by nearly 70%.
